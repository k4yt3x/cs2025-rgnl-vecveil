To streamline the election process, Val Verde has implemented a digital check-in system allowing voters to pre-register online and receive a unique digital code, replacing traditional ID checks at polling stations. The system verifies the code upon arrival to ensure only registered voters can proceed to vote. Although these check-in machines are closely guarded, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) wants to ensure that the system remains secure even if someone gains access to one of the machines.

As a hired security consultant, your task is to evaluate the system's security. You are tasked with figuring out how to forge a registration code, demonstrating how an attacker might exploit the system to gain unauthorized access. Your findings will be crucial in securing Val Verde's election.

## Challenge: Forging a Registration Code

Your task is to analyze the binary further to uncover how the digital check-in system's authentication mechanism works. The system generates unique registration codes for each voter, and you must determine how these codes are created.

You are required to forge a valid registration code for General Mateo Alvarez. Successfully generating this code will simulate bypassing the check-in process and impersonating the General. The integrity of your nation rests in your hands!

Calculate the registration code for the name "Mateo Alvarez" and submit it as the flag.
