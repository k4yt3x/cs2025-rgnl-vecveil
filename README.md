For the 45th Canadian federal election in 2025, Canada has implemented a new cutting-edge digital voting system. Each registered voter receives a unique digital code in advance to streamline identity verification at polling stations, thereby enhancing both efficiency and security. Voting machines are deployed nationwide. Despite stringent oversight of these machines, additional measures have been incorporated into the software to ensure it remains challenging for unauthorized individuals to uncover how the authentication code is calculated, even if they somehow gain access to the machines.

You have been hired as a third-party security consultant to analyze the binary file that verifies the voter's name against the authentication code to ensure it has an adequate level of security. There are two stages to this challenge. In the first stage, you are to determine how the program "unpacks" its code; in the second stage, you are to find the authentication code for Pierre Poilievre so you can vote as him for Justin Trudeau.
